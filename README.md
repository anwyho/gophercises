Jon Calhoun has some awesome exercises for learning Go! Here are my take on a few of them. They gave me so many examples to play around with and got me speaking the language. And some of the paradigms I learned here, I'm starting to use in other languages already! 

As of 2020-05-08, I've been taking a break and putting all my effort into a Gatsby app and learning React 16 well. 

Next, I'll be tackling a CRA with a Golang backend to play a card game popular in Hong Kong. The road map includes React, TypeScript, and websockets. And in the future, maybe even WebRTC for a fully peer-to-peer version!
